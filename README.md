Amritha,

I am very glad to know about you and I truly admire the way you’ve already carved a creative path for yourself through editing. The fact that you are not only passionate about it but also earning from it at such a young age shows your dedication and smartness. Balancing studies with a side hustle is not easy, and it proves that you have the discipline and determination needed to succeed in life.

It’s completely okay that you are new to Python or C. Everyone starts somewhere, and what truly matters is your willingness to learn and explore. With your enthusiasm and curiosity, I am sure you will master coding step by step. Mistakes will come, but each mistake will be a stepping stone that takes you closer to mastery.

I also appreciate your honesty and the heartfelt note you shared about your class. Why are you apologizing? It’s not that big of a problem. If someone takes too much control at the beginning of the class, many people might not like it — but we can manage it, it’s not a problem. I believe I can definitely give all of you a strong programming foundation. Thank you for saying my class feels very comfortable. I will always try to give that feeling to you and your classmates.

Keep your confidence high, Amritha, and believe in your potential. One day, you will not only become the person you dream of but also inspire many others with your journey.

All the best — I am excited to see your growth in coding and in life.
